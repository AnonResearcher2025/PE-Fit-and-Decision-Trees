## Introduction

This project aims to enhance our understanding of congruence analysis using decision trees. It includes the necessary data and scripts to generate the plots presented in the article. You can follow this README file to reproduce the plots or apply the models to your data on your PC, or you can follow [this notebook for simulation study](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13TznPwRjq1mt1DhhqaiDle88xCMMAur4#scrollTo=6s-EZ95nz_LX) and [this notebook for empirical study](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19FuYHk3Fhlv5C_3TQOJLMgRbQhH6hASf) to generate the plots on the browser. If you are not familiar with Python, we strongly recommend you work on the notebook.
